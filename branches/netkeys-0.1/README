Netkeys Readme
==============

What is 'netkeys'?
------------------
netkeys is a program designed to transmit key presses from one computer
to another computer.

How do I use it?
----------------
You'll need two computers on a network of some description to be able to
use netkeys. You should know the IP address of the computer which you
want to send key presses to.

Run netkeys on the host computer (the one that is to send the key press)
like so (using the 'A' key as an example):

netkeys --ip 10.0.0.2 A

This will connect to 10.0.0.2 and send any press of the 'A' key to that
computer.

On the client computer (the one that is to receive key presses), run
netkeys like so:

netkeys --client

Now, load Notepad on the client. Press 'A' on your host computer, and if
all has gone well it'll appear as though you just typed 'A' on the
client computer's keyboard.

Where can I get more help?
--------------------------
For more help, run `netkeys --help', or alternatively file an issue on
the netkeys project website: http://code.google.com/p/netkeys.
